# A 30-Minute Automation That Saves You 3 Hours/Week

In the fast-paced world of solopreneurship, every minute counts. You’re juggling marketing, customer service, content creation, and, of course, the core work that fuels your business. What if you could reclaim 3 hours every week by investing just 30 minutes once? Welcome to the power of a simple, effective automation.

## Why Automation?
Automation isn’t about replacing you; it’s about freeing you from repetitive tasks that drain your time and energy. By automating small but time-consuming processes, you’ll unlock hours that can be redirected to growth, creativity, or simply a well-deserved break.

## The Automation We’re Building: Email Follow-Up Reminders for Leads
One of the most overlooked time-sucks for solopreneurs is managing follow-ups with potential clients or customers. Missing a follow-up can mean lost revenue; doing it manually is tedious.

### What You Need:
- An email marketing or CRM tool with automation capabilities (e.g., Mailchimp, HubSpot, or even Gmail with add-ons)
- A task or reminder app (optional, but helpful)

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough

#### Step 1: Identify Your Follow-Up Window
Decide how long after your initial contact you want to follow up — typically 2-3 days is ideal.

#### Step 2: Set Up an Automated Email Sequence
1. Create a draft email template that’s friendly, concise, and reminds your prospect of your initial conversation or offer.
2. In your automation tool, set a trigger: When a new contact is added to your "Leads" list or tagged as "Contacted," start the sequence.
3. Schedule the first follow-up email to send 2 days later automatically.

#### Step 3: Create a Conditional Reminder
If your automation tool supports conditional logic, set it so that if the lead replies or engages, the follow-up stops. If not, schedule a second automated reminder 4-5 days later.

#### Step 4: Track and Optimize
Check your automation’s open and reply rates weekly. Tweak your emails’ subject lines or timing to improve engagement.

### Bonus: Integrate with Your Calendar or Task Manager
Add a task reminder for yourself to personally reach out to leads who do not respond after the second email. This ensures no lead is truly lost.

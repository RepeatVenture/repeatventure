## Why Automate?

Automation isn’t just for big companies with huge budgets. As a solopreneur, you wear many hats — marketing, sales, customer support, bookkeeping, and more. Automating repetitive tasks can:

- Save time
- Reduce errors
- Improve consistency
- Boost productivity

By freeing yourself from mundane tasks, you can focus on what matters most: growing your income and delivering value.

## The Automation: Email Follow-Up Sequences

One of the most time-consuming but crucial tasks is following up with leads, clients, or prospects. Manually sending follow-up emails after calls, meetings, or purchases eats into your week. The solution? An automated email follow-up sequence.

### What You’ll Need

- An email marketing platform with automation (e.g., Mailchimp, ConvertKit, ActiveCampaign)
- Your list of contacts or leads
- 30 minutes

### What It Does

Once set up, the system automatically sends personalized follow-up emails at scheduled intervals. Instead of remembering to send emails, your automation does it for you.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### Step 1: Choose Your Email Platform

Pick an email service that supports automation. Most platforms offer free tiers with automation features.

### Step 2: Segment Your Contacts

Organize your contacts based on the action they took (e.g., downloaded a lead magnet, had a sales call, made a purchase).

### Step 3: Draft Your Follow-Up Emails

Write 2-3 concise, friendly follow-up emails. For example:

- **Email 1:** Thank you + recap + next steps
- **Email 2:** Helpful resource or case study
- **Email 3:** Reminder or limited-time offer

### Step 4: Set Up Automation Workflow

Create a sequence in your email platform:

- Trigger: Contact added to segment
- Email 1: Send immediately or after 1 hour
- Email 2: Send 2-3 days later
- Email 3: Send 5-7 days later

### Step 5: Test Your Automation

Add your own email to the list and verify that the sequence sends correctly.

### Step 6: Activate and Monitor

Turn on the automation and watch your saved time grow. Check engagement metrics weekly to optimize.

## Mini Case Study: How Sarah Saved 3 Hours/Week

Sarah runs a coaching business and used to manually follow up with every prospect after a discovery call. This took about 30 minutes per lead, and with 6 new leads weekly, that added up to 3 hours.

After setting up an email automation sequence in ConvertKit, Sarah’s follow-ups were sent automatically. She only needed to review and tweak emails monthly, freeing up 3 hours weekly.

The result? More time to create content and onboard new clients, ultimately increasing her revenue by 20% in 2 months.

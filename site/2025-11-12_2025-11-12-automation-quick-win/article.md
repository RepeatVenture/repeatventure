# A 30-Minute Automation That Saves You 3 Hours/Week

In the fast-paced world of solopreneurs, every minute counts. Imagine reclaiming three extra hours every week by investing just 30 minutes upfront. Sounds too good to be true? It’s not. Welcome to the power of AI automation.

## Why Automation?

As a solopreneur, you wear many hats: marketing guru, customer support, accountant, and product creator. Repetitive tasks can drain your energy and creativity. Automation frees you from mundane chores, letting you focus on growing your business and enhancing your offerings.

## The Automation We’ll Build: Email Follow-Up Sequences

One of the most time-consuming yet essential tasks is following up with leads or clients via email. Instead of manually sending reminders or nurturing emails, you can automate this process using AI-powered tools.

### Tools You’ll Need

- **An Email Marketing Platform with Automation** (e.g., Mailchimp, ConvertKit, or ActiveCampaign)
- **An AI Writing Assistant** (e.g., ChatGPT or Jasper) to craft personalized email content

### Step-By-Step Walkthrough

#### Step 1: Define Your Goal

Decide what you want your automation to achieve. Examples:

- Nurture leads who downloaded a freebie but haven’t purchased
- Send appointment reminders
- Follow-up post-purchase with upsell offers

For this walkthrough, we’ll create a lead nurture sequence.

#### Step 2: Segment Your Audience

Create a segment or tag in your email platform for your target group, e.g., "Freebie Downloaders."

#### Step 3: Write Your Email Sequence Using AI

Use your AI assistant to draft 3-5 emails spaced out over 7-14 days. Examples of prompts:

- "Write a friendly follow-up email reminding a subscriber about the freebie they downloaded and introduce my paid course."
- "Write a persuasive email offering a limited-time discount to new subscribers."

Review and personalize these drafts to fit your brand voice.

#### Step 4: Set Up the Automation Workflow

In your email platform, create an automation:

- Trigger: Subscriber tagged as "Freebie Downloader"
- Actions: Send Email 1 immediately, Email 2 after 3 days, Email 3 after 7 days, etc.

Add conditions to stop the sequence if the subscriber purchases or unsubscribes.

#### Step 5: Test the Automation

Use test emails to make sure triggers and delays work correctly. Check links, personalization, and mobile formatting.

#### Step 6: Launch and Monitor

Activate the workflow and monitor open rates, click rates, and conversions. Use insights to tweak email content or timing.

## Automation Walkthrough: The Email Follow-Up Sequence

One of the most common and time-consuming tasks for solopreneurs is managing email follow-ups. Whether you’re nurturing leads, confirming appointments, or following up on unpaid invoices, this task can eat away chunks of your day.

We’ll use **Zapier** (or any similar workflow automation tool), combined with an AI email assistant like **OpenAI's ChatGPT API** or built-in email templates in your CRM, to automate follow-ups.

### What You'll Need:

- An email service provider (e.g., Gmail, Outlook)
- Zapier (or Make/Integromat)
- Your CRM or spreadsheet to track contacts
- AI email assistant or templated responses

### Step 1: Define Your Trigger

Start by choosing the trigger event in Zapier. For example, "New row added to Google Sheets" or "New contact added to CRM". This will be the point where your automation kicks in.

### Step 2: Filter Your Contacts

Add a filter step to only continue if the contact hasn't responded yet or if a certain date has passed since the last email.

### Step 3: Generate Personalized Follow-Up Email

Use AI to craft a personalized and engaging follow-up email. For example, with OpenAI’s API, input the contact's name, last interaction, and context to generate a natural-sounding message.

### Step 4: Send the Email Automatically

Connect your email provider to send the generated email directly to your contact.

### Step 5: Log the Activity

Update your CRM or spreadsheet with the date and content of the follow-up email. This keeps your records accurate and prevents duplicate emails.

### Step 6: Schedule Recurring Checks

Set this Zap to run daily or weekly to monitor and send follow-ups automatically without manual intervention.

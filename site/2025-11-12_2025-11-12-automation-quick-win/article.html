<h1>A 30-Minute Automation That Saves You 3 Hours/Week</h1>
<p>In the fast-paced world of solopreneurs, time is your most valuable asset. Every minute saved can be reinvested into growing your business or enjoying personal freedom. Imagine setting up one simple automation in just 30 minutes that frees up 3 hours each week. This article walks you through exactly that — a practical, actionable automation using AI tools that will transform repetitive work into effortless efficiency.</p>

<h2>Why Automation?</h2>
<p>As a solopreneur, you wear multiple hats: marketer, customer service, accountant, and more. Many of these roles involve repetitive tasks that drain your time and energy. Automation isn't just for big companies; with AI-powered tools becoming more accessible, solopreneurs can leverage automation to gain a competitive edge and focus on high-impact activities.</p>

<h2>The Automation We'll Build: Email Follow-Up Sequences</h2>
<p>One of the most time-consuming but crucial tasks is managing follow-ups with leads and clients. Forgetting to follow up can mean lost income. Manually sending follow-ups eats into your valuable hours.</p>
<p>Our automation will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatically send personalized follow-up emails after initial contact.</li>
<li>Schedule follow-ups at optimal intervals.</li>
<li>Track responses and adjust the sequence accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<p>This process typically takes 3+ hours weekly when done manually.</p>

<h2>Tools You Need (All AI-Friendly &amp; Budget-Friendly)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Zapier or Make</strong> (automation platform)</li>
<li><strong>Gmail or your preferred email client</strong></li>
<li><strong>Google Sheets or Airtable</strong> (to track contacts)</li>
<li><strong>OpenAI's GPT (via API or integrated in Zapier)</strong> for personalized email content</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step-by-Step Walkthrough</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Set Up Your Contact Database</h3>
<p>Create a Google Sheet or Airtable base with columns for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact Name</li>
<li>Email Address</li>
<li>Date of Initial Contact</li>
<li>Status (e.g., Contacted, Followed Up, Responded)</li>
</ul>
<p>Fill in your recent leads or clients.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Design Your Email Templates</h3>
<p>Use GPT to help draft personalized email templates. For example:</p>
<p><strong>Initial Follow-Up:</strong></p>
<p>"Hi {{Name}},</p>
<p>Just checking in to see if you had a chance to review my last email regarding [your offer]. Let me know if you have any questions or want to hop on a quick call!"</p>
<p><strong>Second Follow-Up:</strong></p>
<p>"Hi {{Name}},</p>
<p>I wanted to follow up one last time to see if you're interested in [your offer]. I’m here to help whenever you’re ready."</p>
<h3>Step 3: Create Automation Workflow in Zapier or Make</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Trigger:</strong> When a new contact is added or the date of initial contact reaches X days ago.</li>
<li><strong>Action 1:</strong> Use OpenAI GPT to generate a personalized email based on the templates.</li>
<li><strong>Action 2:</strong> Send the email through Gmail.</li>
<li><strong>Action 3:</strong> Update the contact status in your spreadsheet.</li>
<li><strong>Action 4:</strong> Wait X days, then trigger a second follow-up if no response.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Step 4: Test Your Automation</h3>
<p>Run tests with a few dummy contacts to ensure emails send correctly, personalization works, and statuses update.</p>
<h3>Step 5: Monitor and Optimize</h3>
<p>Check weekly how many contacts respond, adjust email copy or intervals as needed.</p>

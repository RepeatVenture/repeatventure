<h1>A 30-Minute Automation That Saves You 3 Hours/Week</h1>
<p>In the busy world of solopreneurs, time is your most valuable asset. Every minute saved can be reinvested into growing your business, learning new skills, or simply enjoying life. What if you could set up a simple automation in just 30 minutes that frees up an extra 3 hours each week? This article walks you through exactly how to do that.</p>

<h2>Why Automate?</h2>
<p>Automation isn’t just for big companies with huge budgets. As a solopreneur, you wear many hats — marketing, sales, customer support, bookkeeping, and more. Automating repetitive tasks can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Save time</li>
<li>Reduce errors</li>
<li>Improve consistency</li>
<li>Boost productivity</li>
</ul>
<p>By freeing yourself from mundane tasks, you can focus on what matters most: growing your income and delivering value.</p>

<h2>The Automation: Email Follow-Up Sequences</h2>
<p>One of the most time-consuming but crucial tasks is following up with leads, clients, or prospects. Manually sending follow-up emails after calls, meetings, or purchases eats into your week. The solution? An automated email follow-up sequence.</p>
<h3>What You’ll Need</h3>
<ul>
<li>An email marketing platform with automation (e.g., Mailchimp, ConvertKit, ActiveCampaign)</li>
<li>Your list of contacts or leads</li>
<li>30 minutes</li>
</ul>
<h3>What It Does</h3>
<p>Once set up, the system automatically sends personalized follow-up emails at scheduled intervals. Instead of remembering to send emails, your automation does it for you.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Walkthrough</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Choose Your Email Platform</h3>
<p>Pick an email service that supports automation. Most platforms offer free tiers with automation features.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Segment Your Contacts</h3>
<p>Organize your contacts based on the action they took (e.g., downloaded a lead magnet, had a sales call, made a purchase).</p>
<h3>Step 3: Draft Your Follow-Up Emails</h3>
<p>Write 2-3 concise, friendly follow-up emails. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Email 1:</strong> Thank you + recap + next steps</li>
<li><strong>Email 2:</strong> Helpful resource or case study</li>
<li><strong>Email 3:</strong> Reminder or limited-time offer</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 4: Set Up Automation Workflow</h3>
<p>Create a sequence in your email platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trigger: Contact added to segment</li>
<li>Email 1: Send immediately or after 1 hour</li>
<li>Email 2: Send 2-3 days later</li>
<li>Email 3: Send 5-7 days later</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 5: Test Your Automation</h3>
<p>Add your own email to the list and verify that the sequence sends correctly.</p>
<h3>Step 6: Activate and Monitor</h3>
<p>Turn on the automation and watch your saved time grow. Check engagement metrics weekly to optimize.</p>
